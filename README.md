# Approximately Symmetrical Face Images for Image Preprocessing in Face Recognition and Sparse Representation based Classification

### Approximately Symmetrical Face Images (ASFI)

The details can be found in the [PR_2016 paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320316000121). 

This code has been evaluated on Matlab.

The program is to evaluate the ASFI algorithms and this code is for the paper

#### File description:
demo_classification: main function for classification
demo_preprocessing: main function for image preprocessing
utility file:
NNClassifier_L1: NN Classifier with L1 distance
Homotopy:   l1-Homotopy: http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~sasif/homotopy/

#### How TO RUN THE CODE
For image classification:
Please derectly run the matlab file "demo_classification.m"

For image preprocessing:
Please derectly run the matlab file "demo_preprocessing.m"

#### OTHERS
Note: This program only presents the image processing and classification results on the FERET database

WORK SETTING:
    This code has been compiled and tested by using matlab    7.0 and R2013a
